So today I had to compile Perl 5.14.4 on a new box running Ubuntu 14.10. Followed the normal procedures for getting [Perlbrew](http://perlbrew.pl) installed, updated patchperl and installed the Perlbrew cpanm. Then went ahead to install perl 5.14.4.

|1|perlbrew install perl-5.14.4 -Duseshrplib|

However, this process fails due to tests of perl failing. As far as Iâ€™ve been able to understand this is becase Ubuntu 14.10 is shipping with GCC 4.9 as default, and there are some issues with compiler-flags changing between versions. See [this bug](https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121505) for more technical details. After fiddling around a little bit I decided to just make Perlbrew skip the tests. How smart this is can be debated, but I have yet to experience any unpleasant effects from this.

|1|perlbrew --notest install perl-5.14.4 -Duseshrplib|

If the above feels unpleasant you can always install gcc-4.6 through apt, set it as default using /etc/alternatives and then having a go at compiling Perl. That works as well. The third option is fiddling with the CPAN-config, setting the CC make_arg so that it points to your gcc-4.6 binary.

Oh, and by the way; the reason I have -Duseshrplib in there is because I need Imagemagick, and the only viable option for getting that with Perlbrew is AFAIK using [Alien::ImageMagick](https://metacpan.org/pod/Alien::ImageMagick), which requires perl to be built with that flag.
