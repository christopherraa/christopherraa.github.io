I’ve run into a quite annoying bug in Kopete. If I start Kopete after booting everything works OK. However if I shutdown the program and try to restart it, then for some strange reason it no longer connects to the MSN-service. If I reboot the computer then everything is ok again. I’ve seen reports of this bug on the Debian- as well as Fedora-mailinglists.

If I checked the ‘Use HTTP-method’-option for the msn-account then everything worked like it was supposed to. So if you have troubles connecting, try that. I’m sure there will be a fix for thins bug out soon.

Problem encountered on Fedora 8, running the 2.6.24-kernel, KDE 3.5.9 and Kopete 0.12.7.
