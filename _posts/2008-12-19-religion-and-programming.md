Can programming be compared to religion? Do we have a situation where you can say “I’m a believer in Haskell”? Apparently Rodrigo Braz Monteiro (one of two main programmers on [Aegisub](http://www.aegisub.net/)) thinks so. After reading his [“If programming languages were religions”-post](http://www.aegisub.net/2008/12/if-programming-languages-were-religions.html) I have to say I agree. It’s a laugh, so if you are a programmer in need of some entertainment his post is a great place to start.

I’ll finish with a small snippet: APL would be Scientology – There are many people who claim to follow it, but you’ve always suspected that it’s a huge and elaborate prank that got out of control.
