At this point my twitter-account and my blog should be nicely tied together using a couple of very nifty plugins. I chose to use separate plugins for displaying latest tweets in the WordPress sidebar and posting on Twitter when I post something new here on the blog. I guess this will be a test of wether or not it is really working.

Check out the WordPress plugin directory for a lot of pretty decent Twitter-plugins. The two I landed on (after some trial and error) was the following:

[Twitter Widget Pro](http://xavisys.com/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-twitter-widget/) (for displaying posts in the sidebar) [WP To Twitter](http://www.joedolson.com/articles/wp-to-twitter/) (for sending notifications on new posts to Twitter)

Anyone else have something interesting to share about Twitter-plugins for WordPress?
