To those of you who keep visiting and commenting on my posts; thank you. I really appreciate the feedback. I figure it’s about time I do my part now, and that is responding to what you’ve told me.

I have gotten a lot of feedback on my [post](http://christopher.rasch-olsen.no/2009/04/14/qt-45-and-mysql-plugin-with-mingw-on-windows-xp/) about getting the MySQL-driver built for Qt on Windows (using MinGW). For some reason people are having difficulties getting the procedure I used to work, even though it has worked for me on several occasions.

This post is just to say that I’m about to start reworking the original article and see what it is I do (and have neglected to write down) that makes it work for me and not some people.

On a similar note; There will probably be a great deal more technical posts here now that things have calmed down a bit in my private life and I have time to actually sit down and write here.

Stay tuned.
